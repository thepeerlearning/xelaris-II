              Zach&apos;s MAP math scores went up 20% from last fall a
              phenomenal leap from the 75th to the 95th percentile in math. We
              believe this improvement is due to all the coding and
              problem-solving work. The MAP test is taken biannually to
              benchmark students in U.S.-based schools. Notably, Zachâ€™s highest
              scoring area was problem-solving a clear impact of learning to
              code.
